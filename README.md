# iCE40-HX8K-B-EVN_experiment
Collection of expansion PCB designs and documents that I created when playing with this board.

* HX8K_exp: expansion board that add 2 PMOD ports and a 64 pin socket.
* AS6C4008_32b: additional board that plug into 64 pin socket to add 4xAS6C4008 SRAM chip (DIP package).
* 8bDAC: Extension board to plug in J2 socket that provide a 8 bit R-2R network and some pinout (that I use to display stuff on a NTSC TV). 
* Documents: some documents.
